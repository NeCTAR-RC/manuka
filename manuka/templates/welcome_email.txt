Hi {{ user.full_name }},


Welcome to the Nectar Research Cloud. As a new user, we've created a trial
project for you called {{ project.name }}. You have been allocated 6 months
of core hours on the cloud which you can use to launch a single core instance or 3 months if you launch dual core
instances. You have also been allocated 10GB of object store quota.

Once you reach 80% of your core hours allocation, we'll send you an email to
let you know. If you would like to continue to use the Research Cloud you
have two options:

1. Join an existing research cloud project
   - Speak to the project manager for access, you will need to notify them
     of your username {{ user.name }}

2. Request to create your own project [1]
   - You will have the option of converting your project trial into a project
     allocation at this stage.

As per the terms and conditions [2] of use that you agreed to upon initial log in to the Research Cloud, please
ensure that you use the Research Cloud in a secure manner, following all
security guidelines and policies. [3]

Self Help, help desk support, service announcements and support forums for the
Research Cloud can be accessed from the ARDC Nectar Cloud Support portal [4].

The Nectar Research Cloud also provides online self paced tutorials and regular live virtual training [5]
for new and existing Nectar Cloud users.

Thanks,
Nectar Research Cloud Team
