Hi {{ user.full_name }},

Welcome to the Nectar Research Cloud. As a new user, we've created a trial
project for you called {{ project.name }}. You have been allocated 6 months
of core hours on the cloud which you can use to launch single or dual core
instances. You have also been allocated 10GB of object store quota.


Once you reach 80% of your core hours allocation, we'll send you an email to
let you know. If you would like to continue to use the Research Cloud you
have two options:

1. Join an existing research cloud project
   - Speak to the project manager for access, you will need to notify them
     of your username {{ user.name }}

2. Request to create your own project
   - Please see https://support.ehelp.edu.au/support/solutions/articles/6000068044-managing-an-allocation
   - You will have the option of converting your project trial into a project
     allocation at this stage.
